***Execution***<br>

* Data Processing: explore data, backup data, clean data, filter data, alter data
* Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Occupancy Rate, Property Sizes (Bedrooms), Top 10 Neighborhoods, Weekend Occupancy, Revenue Estimation, and Listing Analysis
* Visualization: Bar Chart, Table
* Process: calculated listing's attractiveness using review count with minimum night requirement of 7 days or fewer, excluded inactive reviews (no review with 12 month period), added
  columns to remove trailing spaces with new values, selected top 10 neighborhoods for vacation rentals and popular bedroom size, calculated the occupancy rate (% of nights that are
  occupied), estimated revenue generators for investment using VLOOKUP and built-in fucntions and calculated columns

\
***Results***<br>

* Top 10 neighborhoods were at coast line or highly populated area
* On weekend the rentals were booked at full capacity
* Highest revenue correlated with population
* Few neighborhoods with less reviews and high revenue were around coastline 

\
***Recomnendation***<br>
* Neighborhoods around coastline are good for investment reguardless of reviews
* More reviews means more foot traffic and high revenue
* Weeked specials can help to generate high revenue
